## The task: 
>
>You should create one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following.
>
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
> 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
